**credit score**

The goal of this project is to support decision making for a banck, by analyzing a csv file that contains personal information of their clients. The banck wants to know what variables they need to consider while deciding if to lend a loan to a client or not. To help the banck, I need to find the correlation between the clients personal data and their ability to pay it back.

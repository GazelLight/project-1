    "The goal of this project is to support decision making for a banck, by analyzing a csv file that contains personal information of their clients. The banck wants to know what variables they need to consider while deciding if to lend a loan to a client or not. To help the banck, I need to find the correlation between the clients personal data and their ability to pay it back.  "

    "# Summaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.In the \"days_employed\" column I changed all the negative values to positive. Thats becouse you can't work a negative amount of days. I did that by creating a function that identifise negative values and turns them in to positive ones, and then applied them on the column using the apply method.    \n",
    "\n",
    "2.I replaced all the values in the \"days_employed\" column that had values that exceeded the possible amount of years that a client can work. I replaced them by creating a function, that recognizes values above the reasonable range, took the original value and divided it by 10 or 100, depending on how big it was. Then applied the function on the column using the apply method.    \n",
    "\n",
    "3.In the \"education\" column, I replaced all the values that had capitall letters with lower case letters, in case of duplications. I did that using the str.lower method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.In the \"children\" column, I got read of all the values that were negative. No one owes the bank a kid.I did that by creating a function that identifise negative values and turns them in to positive ones, and then applied them on the column using the apply method.    \n",
    "\n",
    "5.There were some values with to many kids in the \"children\" column. So I created a function that identifis an unreasonable amount of kids and divides that amount by 10. Then applied them on the column using the apply method.    \n",
    "\n",
    "6.In the \"dub_years\" column I found that there were values outside of the expected range for a client. To fix that, I found the average age for a client by applying the mean() methode on the reasonble range for age in the column. After that, I created a function that identified all the values outside the range, and replaced them with the mean  value I found.  Then applied them on the column using the apply method.    \n",
    "\n",
    "7.Because of the lack of connection between duplicates and specific columns, I decided to delet them by using thedrop_duplicates() methode.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.after seeing no special connection between the missing values and the all the columns, by using the isnull() method with sum() on every column, I decided to fill \"days_employed\" and \"total_income\" missing values with the columns mean() in relation with the columns I found had the bigest impact on those columns. To do so, I used the groupby() method with the columns and the transform() methode.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.I used stemming method in a function to categorise all the difrent values in the \"purpose\".I did that so it would be easier to evaluet the debt rate in relation to the purpose of the client for asking for a loan. Afterwards I applied the new categoris as the \"purpose\" column new values, using the apply() method. \n",

    "10.I created a function that takes the values of the \"total_income\" column, and divides it to diferent income categories. I did that, so it would be easier to define the debt rate acording to income. Then applied them on the column using the apply method. \n",

    "11.I took all the relevant columns and showed the debt prcentage of the clients depending on their defrent categoris. I did that by creating a \"pivot_table\" taking the \"debt\" values and the columns as index. This was performed on the \"income_level\",\"children\", \"purpose\" and \"education. this enabels me to reach the final conclusions.  \n",

    "1.There is no direct connection between the number of children and being in debt.\n",
    "We see this by the fact that debt doesn't really change between the different categories, unless you don't have kids. \n",
    "So if the client doesn't have kids, it's optimal. But after the first one, it's not a big change.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.When it comes to family status, it seems that if the client has not married, his chances of being in debt are highest.\n",
    "That's probably because these are young people who haven't had time to save enough money yet.\n",
    "The second highest is the civil partnership. Looks like it's better to get married.\n",
    "After a wedding, the chances of debt really go down. It should be reasonable that these are people on the older side of the scale, who have had time to save and make a living.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.In income_level we see that the customer's chances of being in debt do not change according to the level of income.\n",
    "The percentage of people in debt in the filthy_rich category is the same as the do youre best category.\n",
    "It probably stems from the fact that the richer you are, the more you like to spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.And when it comes to \"purpose,\" it seems that people who ask for money to buy housing and real estate are the safest.\n",
    "It could be because people use these things to make more money by renting.\n",
    "Next is a wedding and after that is a car and education. It's probably caused by young people looking for these things. "
